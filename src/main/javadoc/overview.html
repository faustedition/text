<body>
A LMNL Object Model (LOM) implementation for representing marked-up text with multi-layered annotations, that can overlap
arbitrarily.

<p />

<img src="../images/LOM.png" alt="LOM UML class diagram" style="float: right; margin: 1em"/>
A simplified UML class diagram depicting a LOM's central entities is shown on the right. 
The basic concepts, namely <i>documents</i>, <i>layers</i>, <i>annotations</i> and <i>ranges</i>, are derived from the experimental 
markup language <a href="http://www.lmnl.org/wiki/" title="LMNL Wiki">LMNL</a>, the <q>Layered Markup and Annotation Language</q> 
as invented by <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/" title="Homepage">Jeni Tennison</a> and 
<a href="http://www.piez.org/wendell/" title="Homepage">Wendell Piez</a>. Instead of supporting its own syntax for input/output of
LMNL documents (LOM instances) though, as it has been originally proposed for LMNL as a genuine markup language, this implementation
strives to be a cleanroom adaptation of LMNL, that concentrates on the data model. As a means of an extensible input/output format,
serializiation of a LOM in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"  title="wikipedia.org">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
is offered.
